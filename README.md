Demo: https://maktor.github.io/frontEnd_Project_1/

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>I would like to credit http://stackoverflow.com, which allows developers to share and help each other. As I learned and implement parts of code from variuos developers.

This is a simple hangman game that includes one-player and two-player modes. Enabling users to play either with the computer or play with a friend. There were three languages implemented: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Also, most of the code is written using DOM in javascript. Overall, the progress of making this game was smooth.</p>

<h3>INSTALL/RUN</h3>
1. Clone or download the project<br>
2. Unzip the file<br>
3. Open the "index.html" file in the browser or run the npm server<br>

<h3>FILES</h3>
<p>Once you open the zip file, you will see three folders (1p, 2p, src) and two other files (index.html, README.md). The 1p folder includes one-player mode, while the 2p folder has code for two-player mode.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTION</h3>
<p>Once you open the game in the browser, you can choose a mode and start playing.</p>
1. In one-player mode, a computer will choose a random word from the bank of words, and you can start guessing letters by inputting them in the input field<br>
2. In two-player mode, player 2 closes his/her eyes while player 1 chooses a word. Player two had 5 guesses to get the word.
